          Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is the most effective therapy for OCD. It focuses on identifying and changing negative thought patterns and behaviors. A key aspect of CBT is Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP), where individuals are gradually exposed to feared situations and prevented from performing compulsive behaviors.
